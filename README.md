# Assignment 7: Random 3D Morphologies

This project was created using the Pyrosim library (https://ccappelle.github.io/pyrosim/) and pybullet. Codebase adapted from the MOOC ludobots course (https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/).

These creatures are generated by combining a set of rectangular links in random ways (i.e., iteratively attaching them to random faces of each other). As with our 1D Snakes, the green links possess sensors and the blue links do not (this is also randomly determined). In theory, any 3D morphology consisting of links that are not 'too close' together (to minimize intersections) are possible. See the below diagram for a summary of possible creature morphologies. (See the 'snake1d' branch for more details as well.)

Movement is dictated by a fully connected, two-layer neural network connecting sensor neurons to motor neurons.

Commands to replicate the content presented in the video:

```python3 show.py random [number of creatures] [OPTIONAL: number of links per creature (default=5)]```

e.g.\
```python3 show.py random 5```

Would sequentially simulate 5 randomly generated 3D creatures each with 5 links.

```python3 show.py random 3 10```

Would sequentially simulate 3 randomly generated 3D creatures each with 10 links.
